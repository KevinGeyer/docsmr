DOCSMR - Doctors Office Computer System - Medical Records. With these programs, healthcare providers will be able to use an Internet browser to access data customarily found in a medical record including patient visit encounters, in-office test results, outside laboratory and x-ray reports and billing information. 

These programs are being designed to fully integrate with Microsoft Healthvault to allow downloading of patient's existing health information and uploading of new data to the patient's personal health record.

Programming contributions from interested parties are gratefully welcomed.

You may view a running example at our website: http://docsmr.com
